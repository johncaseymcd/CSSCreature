        <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
        <h3>By Casey McDonough</h3>

        <p>I'm originally from Indy, but I lived in various parts of Southern California for a few years as well. Here is a picture I took with a drone over my "backyard" - aka the Salton Sea.</p>

        <p>I have a few passions in life. One of them is food. Here are some of my favorite foods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sushi</li>
        </ul>
